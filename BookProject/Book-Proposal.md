#Book Project Proposal: _Styled by Life_

###Concept
Fashion is more than just following trends and judging what looks good. Fashion is a personal statement and a representation of your lifestyle, drawing from various elements such as your interests, cultural background, or experiences that shaped your current mindset. In _Styled by Life_, a lifestyle blog accompanied by a fashion concept book. I will incorporate photographs I have personally taken as well as images from Pinterest/other social media to represent different aspects of my personal life that inspire me on a day to day basis. After curating all of those images, I will assemble different hand sketched clothing pieces and outfits to show how these aspects of my life show up in my personal style. (Ex. On my blog I might write about my favorite Instagrammable locations in Chinatown. In the book I will create a mood board of photographs of street art in Chinatown --> a sketch of a streetstyle outfit inspired by the art elements)

###Media
- Photographs using a Nikon D3400, edited in Camera Raw/Photoshop/Lightroom
- Book layout created with InDesign
- Hand sketches in ink or color pencil
- Blog created on Wix

###Example of a Lifestyle Theme
My favorite genre of music is dubstep, a subgenre of EDM with a very prominent bass. I first got really into dubstep when I saw Excision, one of the biggest bass artists in the US, live at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. I was fascinated by the culture surrounding the people who listen to his music. At softer raves, the crowd can be pretty dull and homogeneous. All the guys are wearing basketball jerseys and all the girls are wearing the same black Victoria's Secret bralette. Bass fans, also referred to as wooks, are a lot more unique. I see people with psychedelic patterned scarves, skull face masks, bright neon colored fishnets, crazy goggle, and animal print shorts. They headbang with so much energy and aren't afraid of the intensity of the music. To me, this individuality and fearlessness is what I love most about the rave scene.
