# Reflective: What Is A Book?

##The Effort Behind a Book

This week's discussions revolved around *The Book* by Amaranth Borsuk and culminated in a visit to NUArchives to see some examples of changing book styles with our own eyes. *The Book* continues on last week's theme of the many broad definitions of a book. Borsuk breaks the definitions down into four major categories: object, content, idea, and interface. We also viewed some examples in class and at our visit to NUArchives to visualize Borsuk's concepts. It was enlightening to think about all the effort and originality that goes into producing a bookâ€”from handling the materials, to enhancing the visual aesthetic, to forming a strong connection with the intended reader.

Producing the physical aspect of the book was a much more complicated process than I thought. The materials used in books evolved drastically throughout history, and it was interesting to see what these differences indicated about society at the time. One observation we brought up was that the papyrus scroll, one of the earlier forms for writing, actually set the example for navigation on today's digital formats. The scroll allows for continuous writing without the vertical restriction of page length, similar to how we scroll through web pages and interfaces today. A shocking fact about the papyrus material was how expensive and difficult it was to produce, as it is made from animal skins. The medieval book we examined at NUArchives required over a hundred cows to be slaughtered to produce the pages. It's no wonder books were so pricey and difficult to acquire, since the production of just one took up so many resources. It is tragic to imagine a time when only the wealthy could afford books, meaning there was no way for the poor to elevate themselves through education, since they couldn't even access required readings for school. We also examined a book that was made of cheaper wood pulp paper but sold without any binding. In this case, anyone could purchase the pages containing the actual information, but how elaborate the covers and binding were would depend on the buyer's social class. Oddly, our copy at NUArchives still had an unbroken seal around the pages, meaning the owner never intended to read it. Perhaps the owner was wealthy and simply bought the book because he or she could, and it didn't matter whether or not it would be used. The most modern form we looked at, *Between Page and Screen*, also by Borsuk, peaked our curiosity by requiring the use of two drastically different media. Each page in the book had a black square with a different pattern of pixel-like cutouts inside and no text. It was unclear what the story was, until we visited the book's website and opened a webcam feature that would scan the images and turn them into animated text on the screen. Perhaps Borsuk believed that our current generation is easily bored by tradition and needed something whimsical and multidimensional to get excited about reading again. 

As an artist, I am especially drawn to books that incorporate visually creative elements. It is actually quite difficult to carefully balance your visual elements so that they don't distract from the story or information; the most successful examples have visuals that enhance the content. I enjoyed reading about "The Artist's Book", which is intentionally constructed in a way that conveys a theme or deeper meaning. One example that really struck me was *Edges* by Alisa Banks, in which the pages are bound by synthetic hair braided into cornrows and other types of styles to celebrate African culture. On a deeper level, it represented the exclusion of marginalized groups, because the hairs were literally at the margins of the pages. I was also intrigued by the concept of "image-text", a design meant to be both read and looked at. This turned printing into an art, rather than just a method of placing text onto a page. *Songs of Innocence* by William Blake uses a technique called illuminated printing, which involves metal plates with designs painted on using acid-resistant varnish. This innovation reintroduced the creative hand-drawn element of older writing, while using technologies inspired by letterpress. The cover page of *Songs of Innocence* is so beautiful because the illustration of the branches blends in seamlessly with the letters in the title. I also admired this elegant blending of text and imagery in the medieval manuscript from NUArchives, which had the first letter in a section enlarged and decorated with vivid colors. These designs remind me of the concept of type as information versus type as image, which has been drilled into my head by my former typography professor. I find myself more intrigued by a piece of text when my eye is first caught by the artistry of the letterforms before proceeding to read the words they spell out.

We make the most of our reading experiences by trying to connect with the writer or the characters, but it can be extremely unsettling to know that the author dictates the fate of the story. We are often crushed when our favorite character dies, or the protagonist makes a decision that we knew would result in disaster. Once you read that part, whatever happens has already happened, and you can't undo it. It is a challenge for authors to assert their voice and decisions while maintaining the devotion of the reader. This is why interactive books can be such a refreshing experience for the reader who gets a little too invested in the characters' actions. Imagine watching a horror film and being able to actually stop the main character from going alone into a dark basement where the killer is obviously hiding. In class, we looked at the *Choose Your Own Adventure* books in which you would flip to specific pages depending on the path you chose, rather than reading from front to back. Another interactive example mentioned by Borsuk is *Pry* by Samantha Gorman and Danny Cannizaro, in which the reader uses a touch screen to literally pry open lines of text and reveal images of memories and thoughts from the narrator's traumatic past. This is more powerful than simply reading about his past, because you are taking the role of a detective and piecing together the narrator's life yourself.

The different examples of books we read about and looked at in person showed me how much you can appreciate a book when you dig deep into how it was made, both physically and conceptually. We take things like paper and printers for granted, but there is actually a rich history behind these items, and it takes a lot of effort to produce a book. We should take our time when reading, so we can absorb both the story or information and all the visual elements. I've also realized that the medium or media selected by the author is quite purposeful and adds a unique meaning to the book. There are many different elements that come together to make each book stand out from the rest, and we can gain a new experience from reading each one.
