##Type Obsession

I was especially excited about this week's topics, typefaces and fonts, because I have been studying typography excessively since I began my graphic design track. For most of my educational career through high school, we only had a choice between Times New Roman or Arial for typing assignments. When I was finally allowed to use a variety of typefaces, from minimal to more decorative styles, I realized how important type is for conveying a visual message. We subconsciously have emotional responses to different typefaces and it affects how we perceive the displayed text. It was interesting to read about how typographers and designers use typefaces for different purposes, as well as how my own peers feel towards various type styles. 

I was very familiar with the topics discussed in *Thinking With Type*, as I had been forced to memorize all those type terms for a typography course. Typography is an extremely detail-oriented art, where every little space or even the slightest curve between a letter's stroke and its serif makes all the difference to the final design. Going back through the history of typefaces helped me understand the origins of typography and how it became so precise and obsessive. The development of humanist fonts set the bar high for the amount of calculation that went into type design. I was fascinated by the illustration of the humanist letter "A", in which the proportions had been modeled to match those of the average human body. Even the crossbar of the A had been strategically placed to cover where the male genitalia would be, as a symbol of modesty. There is something very clean and rigid about the appearance of humanist fonts, but I would have never guessed the human body shape was behind this aesthetic, had I not seen the illustration. I also noticed the use of the grid layout in the humanist design, which has become the foundation of all good graphic design. Although design has evolved to break more traditional type rules, we almost always adhere to the grid structure as a way to line up different elements and maintain breathable space. As new typefaces such as slab serifs and geometric are developed, we see tradition being broken, but certain key concepts of proportion and alignment are still respected. However, these typefaces did not just immediately depart from the traditional form, but instead small elements of each letter, such as the difference between thickness in strokes, the roundness of finials and terminals, or the height of ascenders and descenders, were tweaked gradually until the appearance was changed significantly. My typography professor used to say that types rules were meant to be broken, but one would have to have a vast knowledge of the original rules in order to find a strong purpose to break them. Even those futuristic pixelized fonts we see in sci-fi comics or video games have their own grid system to them. The pixel system is essentially a grid where each box is the size of a small dot. I was really impressed with how designers adjust the opacity of dots along the edges to produce the appearance of either rough or smooth strokes.

The majority of our discussion in class revolved around the associations we make with different fonts and whether those associations come from a set of general standards for what visual elements mean or just personal experience and emotions. The first thing that came to mind for me was the emergence of Bauhaus during the growth of consumerism. I had first encountered Bauhaus in an art history class in Japan, where we studied the concept of minimalism in ad design. My first impression of the Bauhaus font was that the circle base structure behind each letter made it appear more abstract but also gave it a fun art-deco appeal. It popped out on a flat page design, and it looked good in conjunction with vibrant colors and graphic elements. However, it was still pretty simple without too many ornamental details. I can definitely understand why Bauhaus was so successful in the Roaring 20s. It succeeds at catching one's attention, but is not too flashy and doesn't distract from the main product being advertised. I tend to associate these geometric fonts with playfulness, because the letters themselves look like they could represent something in an image. For example, the a could be an eye or the u could be turned upside down to make a hill. The fact that the letters only come in lowercase also indicates that it would not be very useful for conveying information in proper sentences and paragraphs. On the flip side, I often associate upright serif and sans serif fonts with long blocks of informational text. I even think of the word "boring" when I see these fonts, because we so commonly see textbooks and research papers written in Times New Roman or Arial. However, when going around the room and discussing fonts we found interesting, a lot of other students chose very classic serifs or simple monospaced sans serifs. I, on the other hand, had chosen a very obscure font called Fit, in which the strokes were designed to intentionally take up such an overwhelming amount of space that the letters became unreadable. To answer our big question on the associations we make with fonts, I suppose there are general visual standards of what we see as informational type design and artistic type design, but they are not set in stone. Our preferences for what fonts make us feel happy or calm differ greatly, and those might be tied to personal experience.

Our readings and discussions this week helped me understand why designers, including myself, are so obsessed with the minor details of type. Typography is an important part of any text layout, whether it's a block of information or an abstract design. Typefaces are a form of expression for the user and can affect the mood of the viewer. What we learned this week will help me make better decisions when it comes to choosing a font to fit the purpose of my written work and designs.
