## Questions or Observations

1. Does the concept demonstrated in "Baxter's Procrustes" that people elevate the prestige and exclusivity of a book by keeping its contents a mystery hold true today? Do people buy rare editions of old books or fancy coffee table books only to admire the value but never read it? Does this concept also apply to other luxury goods such as clothing or furniture?
  
2. "Oh Look, a Ferry; or the Smell of Paper Books" brings up the idea of a book as a conveyer. How is the passing on and consumption of a book similar to the transportation of people and supplies via ferry? 

3. In "How to Design an Awarded Letterpress Printed Book," Dantas states "we didn't want to be Printers but Designers that Print"? What distinguishes a printer from a designer that prints? Both must have a detailed knowledge of the materials they work with and have a carefully planned vision of how their layout will transfer onto the page, but is there a difference in the mindset or process of a designer?
