# Reading Prep: Zines

## Questions or Observations

1. How should we go about handling Zines with very sensitive personal topics? While Zines are important tools to give us a glance into historical periods or specific cultures, it is imperative to respect the privacy of the authors who might have taken a huge risk to share certain aspects of their lives, such as coming out about their sexuality. How can we share these works while being sensitive of the potential consequences publicity may have on the author? Or should we try to keep Zines limited to the more underground scene?

2. What feelings are evoked from erasure poetry by having the visual aspect of crossed out or obscured text as opposed to just seeing the highlighted words in one clear sentence? For example, in the crossout poetry example, we see "I have to step away from the fun but I am comfortable and safe." How would you perceive this line differently if it had just been written as a plain sentence?

3. A common theme among all Zines seems to be freedom. Many marginalized groups use Zines as a form of expression to break free from oppression or ignorance. In Pagan's case, she broke free from the rigid rules of high level writing by using wild fictional scenarios, writing about herself, and including a lot of doodles and clippings. Online Zines are supposed to be a free space from the harsh criticism and standards of social media. Traces expresses freedom by using a quirky, colorful format with interactive features and a lot of personal elements such as hand-drawn styled annotations to the text.
