# Reading Prep: Book Alterities

#### Lauren Moy

## Questions or Observations

1. Immortality seems to be a prevalent theme in the readings. To what extent is the quest for mortality of books reasonable or ethical? It is true that we need to preserve recordings and documents in order for future generations to have information about the past, but perhaps materials are meant to have a set lifespan. Are ideas such as *The Xenotext* which involves achieving immortality through a living organism too radical? Or are ideas like creating sacred books that will never be read by anyone even useful to societies?
  
2. In altered books, what relevance does the actual book used have to the finished product? In "A Crash Course on Altered Books," many of the books are old, cheap books purchased from thrift stores and the new images placed over the pages represent completely new ideas. What is the value of painting these images over a cheap thrifted book as opposed to using a canvas, a newspaper, or some other kind of surface? Does the choice of book content hav eany relevance to the author?

3. How can digital books combat the distraction that comes with the technology age? How can a digital or audible book compete with the flood of phone calls, texts, or notifications from social media apps? How can the digital book dominate in a space that is crowded with so many different influences?
