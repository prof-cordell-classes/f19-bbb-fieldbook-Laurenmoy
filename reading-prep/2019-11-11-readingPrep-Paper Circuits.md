]# Reading Prep: Fabrication II

## Questions or Observations

1. How does *The Hollow* compare to the book *Boundless* that we looked at in the NUArchives? How does making text content that is inaccessible or difficult to access change the way the reader perceives the purpose of the book?

2. The quote "a digital book shouldn't mean we need to let go of the emotional connection to a physical object" by Alyson Fielding is interesting. The lack of physical connection and tactile pleasure is one of the main criticisms of books that use up and coming technology. Perhaps creators can find a way to use technology in a way that contains interactive physical elements. 

3. The conclusion of "Thinking as Handwork" poses an interesting question: who is the audience of critical making? It could be the makers themselves, as they get a chance to tinker with an idea they're passionate about. It could be any other relevant viewers who share their fascination with the same topic. It could also be people from other fields in science and art who get pulled into the project to collaborate and bring different perspectives.
