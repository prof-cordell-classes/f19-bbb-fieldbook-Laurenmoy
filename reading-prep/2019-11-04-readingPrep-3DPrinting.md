## Questions or Observations

1. The Lego comparison from *A New Companion to Digital Humanities* is an interesting way to begin looking at the technologies behind physical computing. Many children from a young age discover through Legos that there are a variety of ways to build different products starting with the same base unit. Through Legos, people created a community in which they could share ideas and instructions for building an endless possibility of items. In physical computing, this same idea of creating an endless possibility of 3D objects exists. 

2. To what extent are people using 3D printing to create something meaningful? Because there are infinite possibilities and capabilities with 3D printing, this could lead to people printing something outrageous just because they can. They might have no real intention in mind, but they just want to test and witness the abilities of 3D printing by choosing an object that is seemingly challenging to produce. 

3. The Mic Jammer from "Making Things and Drawing Boundaries" was the most interesting project to me. The object can mute smart phones by releasing an ultrasonic signal at a frequency that humans can't hear but technologies can. I find this technology a bit eerie, because it personifies technology, and many people are growing fearful of the increasing human-like abilities of their devices. The idea of two technologies communicating in a form that humans can't understand is quite eerie to me.
