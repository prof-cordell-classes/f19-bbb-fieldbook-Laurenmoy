# Reading Prep: E-Lit II

## Questions or Observations

1. *With Those We Love Alive* had a strange effect of somehow making me feel trapped by my screen in the story, even though I could have just closed the browser at any time. The music was eerie and the descriptions of the setting were horrifying. It was extremely disturbing and definitely not the kind of place I wanted to be in, but for some reason, I could not keep clicking. Even when the options became dull and repetitive, I kept clicking through waiting for something new to happen, knowing the next event would be another tragic one. The story had an addicting game-like quality. 

2. Does the ability of experienced computer hackers enhance or ruin the experience of Elit? In the instance of the Agrippa files, the hackers had defeated the author's original intention of the poem being something you could only read once. However, by preserving it, they allowed the poem to be more easily shared and closely studied, which creates a new purpose. 

3. Are Elit pieces more effective when they fall into the entertainment category? I found the Lazy Cat video very enjoyable, and I thought the format was perfect for portraying the story. It was not as deeply meaningful as the other pieces we looked at, but a lot of times when people are browsing on their phones or computers, they might just be looking for light playful content. 

The piece I chose from *Electronic Literature Collection* was "Up Against the Screen Motherfuckers." The introduction was very visually stimulating and even had some hypnotic beeping sounds. Then I was shocked by the aggressive narrator who starts screaming demands at me. The visual of a military soldier added to this tone as well. Some of the words the narrator used were very ambiguous, but it seemed to be some kind of social statement about the competency of people who stare blankly at their screens and just click mindlessly.
