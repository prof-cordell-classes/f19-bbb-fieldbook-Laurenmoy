## Questions or Observations

1. How does the change in font styles over time reflect the evolution of the marketing and advertising industry? For example, humanist fonts from the 15th century have relatively thin strokes with smooth serifs and not much variation in thickness. It is likely that at this time, the main purpose of designing text was simply to convey information that could be read easily. As we evolve into more rounded, abstract fonts such as the slab serif or geometric, the letterforms become more visually interesting even though they are not as simple on the eye for reading. With the boom of commercialization and mass consumerism in the 20th century, these fonts in ads could trigger more excitement or emotional responses from people looking at them. 

2. Can you always tell what the best use for a font is by how it looks? For example, I always think of scripts and slab serifs as best suited for covers or decorative text, whereas a basic sans serif or a clean serif font are better for long paragraphs of information. However, there are quirkier fonts such as Wingdings that wouldn't be used as commonly and don't have a clear purpose. In "Brooklyn in Your (Type)Face", the designer created the font simply for the aesthetic and left the purpose up to the user.

3. The introduction of web interfaces added a whole new level to typographic hierarchy. When we look at a flat page, all the information is presented to us on one page and we simply view the text from the focal point to the smaller details. On a web format, the space in which text is presented extends across several pages and touch points that exist in a nonlinear sequence. Every user's navigation path may be different depending what they click. In my experiences with web design, I found that even more thought had to go into hierarchy, as sometimes I would change the color of links to show they were being hovered over or had been visited before. Navigation bar links would have to be different than simple hyperlinks within a paragraph. 

Typeface: Fit 

I love the concept of a font that is intentionally unreadable. In this font, the strokes of each letterform are so thick and overwhelming, that I find myself gravitating towards the thinner, more modest negative space between for comfort. The white spaces form a very interesting maze-like design.
