# Reading Prep: E-Lit I

## Questions or Observations

1. Although the introduction of books on digital interfaces may seem like an innovation that makes reading easier and more convenient, it actually introduces a lot of challenges in terms of recall and navigation throughout the book. I never thought of this before, but it is true  that with a paper book, I always like to check my progress in relation to the beginning and end. I also may have to flip back to previous pages if a certain part of the story continues across multiple pages, which is a little more counter-intuitive to do with a scrolling format online.

2. Is there any purpose in e-book creators trying to make the digital format replicate aspects of paper books, such as creating sounds for the flipping of pages or trying to show depth on each side of the screen? Is it better to focus on developing e-books into something totally new that has abilities paper can't accomplish? *Pry* is a great example of an e-book that intentionally departs from the capabilities of paper books by allowing the reader to physically tear lines apart using the touch screen. 

3. I found *What Football Will Look Like in the Future* to be a very frustrating experience. Initially, I did not like how the article at the beginning disintegrated before I was done reading it. As mentioned in "The Reading Brain in the Digital Age," it was impossible for me to determine how close I was to the end of the story, and the story was quite long. I also quickly forgot what had happened earlier in the story as I progressed and did not want to go through the effort of rewinding through several screens. Another flaw was that the Youtube videos embedded in the stories contained external links to other videos by the same author, which could ruin the sequence of the plot.
